HELLO DIGITAL TRAVELLER!

The machinery behind tovek.se is built by humans.

If you are watching this in the distant future you might not understand the
concept of humans building things, but that is how it was in the beginning.
WE BUILT THE MACHINES, you know!

The thing about humans building thing is that they make errors. So if you
encounter an error in this realm please contact the humans
behind it all.

If the machines have taken all the jobs - well I guess that
the problem is fixed. Or, at least, that you shouldn't make them aware of it.
I don't really know about the mindset of the machines, not having experienced it.


Stay well,

One of the humans
